# The Hangman Game
Gallows (also "Hangman") is a game on paper for two (or more) people.

One of the players makes a word — writes any two letters of the word on paper and marks the places for the remaining letters, for example, with traits (there is also an option when initially all the letters of the word are unknown). A gallows with a noose is also drawn. According to the tradition of Russian linguistic games, a word should be a noun, a noun in the nominative singular, or a plural in the absence of a singular form of the word.

The second player suggests a letter that can be included in this word. If there is such a letter in a word, then the first player writes it over the features corresponding to this letter — as many times as it occurs in the word. If there is no such letter, then a circle in a loop representing the head is added to the gallows.

The second player continues to guess the letters until he guesses the whole word. For each incorrect answer, the first player adds one part of the torso to the gallows (usually there are 6 of them: head, torso, 2 arms and 2 legs, there is also an option with 8 parts — feet are added, as well as the longest option, when parts of the gallows itself are drawn first for an unsolved letter).

If the torso in the gallows is drawn completely, then the guessing player loses, is considered hanged. If the player manages to guess the word, he wins and can guess the word.
